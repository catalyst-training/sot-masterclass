# Description

You have an amazing opportunity to participate in a hands on half-day training
session with Donovan Jones and Colton Vermilyea from Catalyst IT. You'll find
out what the Cloud really is and how to automate it using Ansible.

During the session, you'll be guided through deploying a web application from
scratch to the Catalyst Cloud, a New Zealand based public cloud built on
OpenStack.

If you'd like to participate in this Masterclass, you should have at least
baisc familiarity of the command line as you'll be using that extensively on an
Ubuntu server.

Places are STRICTLY limited to 8 people per session. If you register, you are
committing to attend.

If your plans change, you MUST withdraw from the event so that someone else can
get your spot.

This opportunity is fantastic, and we want to make sure that all 8 spots are
taken for each session.
